This is new to me.  I am a straight forward person and would like to explain my loan request.  I am looking to consolidate lines of credit, credit cards, etc...  My mother is ill and is on a transplant list. I  have taken out some loans to help my mother and ease some of her financial burden. Along with my own debt, it has been a bit overwhelming, but I  I have an excellent job, lots of motivation and determination.  I have ways to pay off debt, where she does not.  The 16000.00 would be used for this and only this.  I am not wanting anything other than just to manage things a bit easier and relieve some of the daily stress that I have.  I am a trustworthy person and would like someone to take a chance on me.  I know that my credit is not perfect, but my scores have been getting higher and I have been working hard for the past few years to make a difference on my credit report.  I have a request like many others, I am sure. My credit may come across to some as a high risk, but I can assure you that I am not.  I take my debts seriously and take responsibility for them. I have helped more than I should at times, but that is who I am.  I am confident in myself and want you to be as well.  Thank you for your consideration!<br/> Borrower added on 05/01/10 > This loan is very secure for the lender.  I have a very stable job and take pride in my work ethics.  I am simply trying to pay down my debt, increase my credit score, and manage my debts as simple as possible.  I am not a risk and have worked hard over the ast few years to really understand how to increase your credit and be considered a good candidate when applying for loans.  I would be thankful to the person or persons who fund my loan.  I am hoping to close this as soon as possible.  I want to change my current situation.  I would like one line vs. 6 or more.  I am making a difference not only for me but my faimly.  I would also be interested in doing future business with a lender that is willing to take a chance on me now.  I am true to my word and have many goals past the one I am trying to accomplish right now.  Again, thank you for your consideration. This is a whole new way to work with others to help each other- where both parties benefit.  I am hopeful that I will be a customer for many years to come.  Maybe someday for something a bit more exciting, but I am on my way!<br/> Borrower added on 05/02/10 > Here are the details of the debts I am looking to consolidate.  If I am fully funded I am going to get as many lines paid down as I can.  I usually pay more than the minimum and I would continue to do this on this one loan as well.   That would offset some of the higher interest being paid on some.  My overall payment would be lower and I would increase my credit score with the fewer number of lines and revolving credit.  I am not looking to continue to keep more than one cc. when pd off. I will close and pay off.  I believe I should let them report paid with a o balance and then start closing them.  I will seek advice on what it the best route.

I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk. When I looked at Lending Club I realized that on this site, I could get better terms that I could at any bank! So I decided to post my listing here.  Thank you for reading my request. If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me on here.","small_business","I am expanding my business.","112xx","NY",2.86,0,"8/1/01",0,0,0,4,0,10296,42.5,8,"f",NA,1,1

The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.   I am an excellent candidate because I have great credit history and payment for the last 7 years when I first established credit. My fico score is 736 on Equifax. My cost of living is going to change dramatically. I will be moving back with my family to once again help them out. But I am looking forward to it since it would reduce my expenses by $700-$800 monthly. This would afford me the opportunity to get the wheels of the financial fortune turning.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash. Since taking ownership of the Cold Stone, same-store sales have increased 14%--one of the highest increases of all 1,400 stores nationwide.","small_business","More capital to buy existing business","981xx","WA",6.41,0,"1/1/02",2,NA,NA,9,0,1932,11.4,14,"f",NA,1,1

My history is as follows: 4 years with the U.S. Air Force, where I was trained in graphic design. I have been consistently employed as a graphic designer since exiting the Air Force in 1996. I have been with my current company (full time) since March 2001. My wife is also employed at a local dog boarding kennel since March 2008 as the manager. Her experience in animal care began in 1996, at a local veterinary hospital where she spent the next 9 years. Her exit from this location was amicable one, as she was offered to help another doctor open his 2 new practices. This took approximately 2 years, from there she was offered yet another venture of opening the kennel of a National pet store chain. After several years of working overtime for others in order to run their business's, we decided that she could have been working this hard to open her very own place. We are grateful for all the experience she has had in the blood, sweat and tears of opening a new business but we are ready to sweat for ourselves. I have no plans to leave my current full time job anytime in the near future, and my wife will be working at her current job, up until it is no longer humanly possible after opening our own location. This was not decided quickly or lightly, especially in these economic times. Thankfully, we remain employed and are able to pay our bills and mortgage on time. We've spent the past 8 months reading, researching and questioning other business owners in our area and have received excellent advice and feedback on our &quot;dream&quot; and we are ready to put her experience in the pet care industry to use.

I would like to furnish my apartment, but i can not get a loan because my credit score is too low.  I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.    I would like to request a loan in the amount of $15,000.  I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.  I am interested in applying for the loan.    Thank you.  Cheareen Jones    ","home_improvement","I WOULD LIKE TO FURNISH MY APARTMENT","071xx","NJ",5.17,1,"12/1/95",2,16,0,2,0,1340,53.6,16,"f",NA,1,1

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

My monthly expenses are as follows: Rent: $900.00; Car Insurance for myself and my two daughters is: $163.77; I have no car payment; my utilities average between 120.00-232.00, depending on the time of year.

I have always made my payments and have strong sense of responsiblity in fulfilling and any and all obligations I am responsible for. The last year and half has been an extremely tough for my family and I. As is with a lot of people I realize. My oldest daughter had some personal issues that as a mother I could not turn her away, so I helped her. In  helping her I aquired debt on my credit cards. Additionally there were medical problems that my insurance company did not cover or they only paid a certain percentage. I was forced to put the balances on my cards. It has been a very difficult time, but I am deteremined to make it through. I appreciate any help that can be given. I have always honored my debts and have always strived to do the best with what I have been given. I have never, nor do I ever intend to file bankruptcy. I will do what is necessary and work as hard as is necessary to fulfill my obligations. Thank you for any consideration you give me.

I apologize for the inaccurate information I provided previously.<br/> Borrower added on 03/15/10 > I have had several investors today ask the particulars regarding the remaining revolving credit not combined in this loan request. I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked.

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.  I would deeply appreciate an understanding of the unfortunate circumstances of the situation and any willingness to help.","other","Liability for 3rd party IRS debt","984xx","WA",10.56,0,"10/1/91",1,NA,NA,6,0,25121,88.4,12,"f",NA,1,0

I am also a Lending Club lender and as such, will try to answer the questions I see asked most often in listings. However, if I have miss anything, ask away and I'll do my best to answer.<br/><br/>Employment<br/>==========<br/>I am a software engineer for a privately funded startup company. The company has been in existence for right at 2 years and I have been with them for 1.5. We integrate biometric solutions with banking software. Our investor is founder and chairman of one of the most widely used core banking systems in the world, which gives us a unique advantage as a startup. I will be traveling to Africa in October to install our second client. We also have 5 more signed contracts awaiting installation over the next 2 years.<br/><br/>Home Equity<br/>===========<br/>I refinanced my house earlier this year in order to convert it from a 7/1 ARM to a fixed 30-year and reduce the rate. The appraisal came in at $220,000.00 during the refinance while Zillow estimates the property at $213,000.00. I currently owe $175,000.00 on the house and there is no second mortgage or HELOC associated with the house, only the first mortgage. When refinancing, I made a large payment at closing in order to reduce the amount owed to just under 80%, thus avoiding PMI. However, this payment wiped out most of the savings that would have been used to finance the wedding.<br/><br/>Debts<br/>=====<br/>I do have two credit cards whose balances have risen recently due to some of the initial wedding expenses. They are both American Express cards. One is at $3400 while the other is at $2500. The rates on these two cards are both at 13.24%. The first $5900 from this loan will go directly to paying off these two cards.<br/><br/>Budgeting<br/>=========<br/>I follow a 60 / 10 / 10 / 10 / 10 budgeting scheme and use Mint to manage my finances. 10% to retirement, 10% to long term savings, 10% to short term savings, 10% to fun, and the rest, 60%, to cost of living (mortgage, lending club loan payment, bills, clothes, gas, etc.). Each of the first three 10% amounts are auto-drafted on pay day. This leaves my budget roughly as outlined below:<br/><br/>$4820 : Net Monthly Income<br/>-------------- 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 --------------<br/>$500 : Retirement<br/>$500 : Long Term Savings<br/>$500 : Short Term Savings<br/>$500 : Fun<br/>---------------------- 60 ---------------------<br/>$1250 : Mortgage<br/>$130 : Mobile Phone (Family Plan)<br/>$100 : Power (average over last 3 bills)<br/>$30 : Gas (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$22 : Garbage (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$36 : Lawn<br/>$16 : Water (rounded average over last 3 bills)<br/>$400 : Groceries (rounded average over last 3 months)<br/>=====================================================<br/>$836<br/><br/>The 60% can obviously fluctuate, but with the savings already factored in, there should be plenty of wiggle room. In addition, I have not adjusted my tax withdrawals, which left me with a more than $3000 return this past year. I intend on reducing my withholdings, which would increase my montly income beyond what is listed here.<br/><br/>Intentions<br/>==========<br/>The three year term on this loan is seen as a worst case to me. I plan, and hope, to have the loan paid off in 2 - 2.5 years.<br/>","wedding","Lender Getting Married","300xx","GA",3.01,0,"6/1/95",3,38,NA,9,0,7114,16.5,19,"f",NA,1,0

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

The funds will be an extension to the bridge of capital on-hand to assist in expanding our business and making necessary purchases and upgrades that will not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal operations, but also greatly enhance the customers' overall shopping experience. We will use the funds for the following: A cash register with robust storage and automation capabilities; more shelving for the larger storage room; a larger company sign, advertisement in adjacent communities, small customer and employee incentives, inventory scanners, aesthetic details and upgrades that appeal to the senses of our customers, a larger retail space. What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>","small_business","Expansion","735xx","OK",0,0,"4/1/02",2,NA,NA,2,0,0,0,18,"f",NA,1,0

I want to provide the best representation possible but this means the appropriate resources, including but not limited to, fax/copier/printer/scanner; legal billing system; incorporation costs and fees; legal search engine subscriptions; legal malpractice insurance costs; and subscriptions to programs which help to obtain new clients. Ultimately I need a foundation from which to begin and that foundation is money. I am not attempting to be a non-profit. I simply want to serve those in the middle to lower socioeconomic classes (and small independent businesses) that share the same legal problems, if not worse, than those in higher socioeconomic classes.

My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?

The group was started three years ago on meetup.com, and has now grown to over 900 members, its membership steadily increasing even with people joining and leaving every day. We have regular meetings at a local bookstore, where the average attendance is about 50 people at each official monthly meeting. We also hold photo outings and workshops in the interim between meetings, with an average of about 20 to 30 participants.  We're currently expanding our operations to include a fully functional social networking website, where members can log on, have their own page and portfolio space, talk on the forums, post events to the calendar, and patronize local businesses whom we've partnered with in exchange for a group discount on their services. We'll of course be selling adspace as well as using more innovative techniques for taking in revenue, such as hosting links to amazon.com for photography-related books and other such photography-related products and services.  We've already begun construction of the site, and we've already invested a fair amount into the group (around $2,000), which has yielded a great amount of success. However, to go further we'll need a relatively small loan of $3,000 to ensure the website's completion and full working order. The loan will also allow us to furnish the group with technological necessities (a dedicated computer and eventually a digital projector) which allow for the group to be regularly maintained and developed. The group's presence and success can be observed publicly at its current online location: photo.meetup.com/438, where anyone can see the number of members, previous meetings and their attendance, and the nearly unanimous praise for the group and its activities.  Having three years under our belt has taught us a great deal about how to interact with the community and how to provide a true service without charging for basic membership or normal activities. Our aim is to keep this model at all costs and to only charge for services and opportunities provided which are above and beyond the normal routines of the group and the corresponding benefit to its members. In this case, such above and beyond circumstances include participation in group showings at local galleries (which generally charge a utilization fee for us to use in the first place) as well as premium member account benefits on the website that's currently under construction (such as unlimited uploading of photos, fewer ads, etc.).  My own credit rating is reputable enough, as you can see, and I've never made a late payment. As an investor in this business, you can expect the same reliability in the returns you'll be provided with, given your interest and participation in this loan. Thank you greatly for your time, and I look forward to working with you indirectly as a partner in this project.","small_business","The Austin Photography Group","787xx","TX",0.95,0,"5/1/91",0,34,NA,4,0,1870,5.5,5,"f",NA,1,0

I would like to consolidate these debts to get a lower interest rate, and pay down the debts faster.  I have excellent credit, and would be happy to answer any investors questions if you need further details.<br/> Borrower added on 01/11/11 > Personal Plea!<br/><br/>First THANK YOU to everyone who has invested so far! I appreciate your support. Second, I would like to take a few moments to appeal to any would-be investors.  <br/><br/>This is the most I have ever been in debt, and I am trying frantically to climb out as fast as I can.  Like I said, I have incurred several 1 time expenses that had to be put on my credit card including medical expenses, car repairs, and thanks to a mix-up by my former employer, some back taxes.  I am applying for this loan to get a lower interest rate.<br/><br/>I have an excellent payment history. I also have excellent job security. I am a postdoctoral fellow, currently doing neurobiology research.  Currently I have a 3-year contract, with an option to renew after that. In addition, I am a licensed pharmacist, so if anything were to happen, I could always pick up a pharmacy job, so my income is very very secure at this time. During my time as a graduate student, I received a small but decent stipend.  Despite all the debt I incurred, I was still able to pay off my car, and pay off some undergraduate loans during my graduate school career.  At this time, I am still making all my payments on time, and making progress on paying down my debt. This loan is very vital, as it will allow me to pay down my debt faster, and will allow me to get away from high credit card interest rates.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for taking time to consider financing my loan. After my debt is paid off, I can start to think about planning a wedding (it is out of the question now, I want to pay my debt off first) and start a family.  Thank you for you time and consideration. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.<br/>","credit_card","Credit card consolidation","666xx","KS",24.35,0,"10/1/99",0,NA,NA,16,0,18056,49.1,36,"f",NA,1,0

I typically pay more than the minimum due but the interest rates and annual fees keep going up and the banks continue to lower my credit line.  This is impacting my debt to credit ratio, which is further impacting my credit score.<br/><br/>Stability:  I've been employed with the same company for 15 years and work in IT.  I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)

I greatly appreciate your assistance in getting this funded.  I am a 28 y/o professional that helps Drs. at a world Famous hospital in Minnesota get funding for research to help patients.  I love having the opportunity to make the lives of cancer patients better, and help develop new techniques for radiation oncology.  It is incredibly stressful, but also reqarding.  <br/>Life hit a speed bump when I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety earlier this year, and then got worse when my wife decided that she was going to divorce me.  Because of the divorce my wife has kind of taken control, and I pretty much only see my adorable 15 month old daughter every other Saturday.  (I'm tearing up just thinking about it.)  My plan with this money is to assist me with divorce attorney fees because my family has never had money like her family has.  I also want to purchase a cruiser motorcycle that I can use for the occasional trips to visit my daughter where my soon to be ex leaves the house and I spend time with my little girl there.  I think this will really save on gas money.  Also, I just think that riding on the open road (helmet for me of course), would be a great stress reliever.  I really just need to feel less stress..., feel happy, and feel normal again.<br/><br/>Thank you for all of you that look at this and help.  I could really use this for so many reasons right now.  I hope it will happen.  <br/><br/>Thank you all in advance.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Seth B.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank everyone so much.  If  I am fortunate enough to obtain this loan, it will be used for a bike.  It will also be used to pay off some higher interest credit cards, and medical bills that I was left with as the result of a recent divorce.  Thank you all so much in advance.  I hope this is able to come through soon.<br/><br/>Best Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > Thank you all so much.  I am just finishing going through a divorce, and this will help with medical bills I was left with so that they can be paid and the hospital won't try to be collecting from me.  Also, I was left with a higher interest card with a balance and this would help take care of that.  Also, I have been through a great deal since before last November (depression, illness, injury, divorce...and now I am only currently able to see my 15 month old daughter every other Saturday, and that's usually not even spending the night...) I have always wanted a bike (non-sports/rocket) in order to get some open air (helmet of course), and just try to be a little bit happier since it has been so long since I have.  I appreciate all of your help.  Thank you, and best regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/21/10 > Thank you everyone that has helped so far.  I really appreciate it.  I just wanted to let it be known that I will have additional medical expenses for myself that would also need to be covered by this.  This will help with costs, and fees that the hospital would normally add on, but will then take away from the &quot;stress relief&quot;/'fun money&quot;.  (It is more important for me to get bills taken care of than to purchase a bike as a post divorce stress-reliever, even though I think it would have assisted me with some other issues I am currently dealing with.  Once again I appreciate all of your help and consideration.  It means so much to me.  <br/>Best Regards.<br/> Borrower added on 07/21/10 > Thank you all so much so far.  I hope this can help me move on a bit faster.  The process has went quickly so far.  I really hope this can be funded.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>","debt_consolidation","Axing the APR","941xx","CA",16.8,0,"12/1/90",0,NA,NA,9,0,49692,89.3,22,"f",NA,1,0

In those two years, I had a few jobs which didn't pay particularly well and a few months of unemployment.  I relied too heavily on credit cards to fill the gaps when my job wasn't enough.  Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.  I'm still young but I'm starting to think of my financial future and I'm confident this is the first step.

My daughter, a senior at the University of North Florida, was late completing the Federal Student Aid (FSFSA) request. The request is now complete, however, it will take the school 3 weeks to provide the information to my daughter's lender (Well Fargo). Once Wells Fargo receives the required information the money will be sent to the university and the college will issue a refund of the $2000. Upon receipt, the funds will be repaid.   The loan has to happen quickly because she will lose the classes needed to graduate next year.   Your help in this matter is greatly appreciated.
